# graph-search
A python GUI application the represents the graph search algorithms

# The Search algorithms
there are 5 search methods that i used in this project which are
1. Breadth First Search
2. Depth First Search
3. Uniform Cost Search
4. Iterative Depening
5. Greedy Best First Search
6. A Star Search

# My Application
* You Basically Start The Application by running the Welcome.py file
* To Run The Welcome.py File Use The Following Cmd Command: python Welcome.py

* You Can Choose Whether To Use A Directed Or Undirected Graph Using The Buttons Shown Below

* First, You Have The "Add Node" Button That Will Add A New Node To The Graph
* Next, you have the "Add Edge" button that you can use to connect your graph
* You can set the start and goal nodes of your graph by using Set Start and Add Goal (You can have multiple goals, and the application will choose the closest goal based on the searching algorithms)

* After Submitting you will have an ordered list of the visited nodes as well as the solution path from start node to the goal node
